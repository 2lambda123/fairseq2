to train custom models for translation, summarization, language modeling, and
other content generation tasks.

   Please note that fairseq2 is primarily a research library. This means
   backwards compatibility between releases is kept at a best effort and is not
   always guaranteed. You should exercise caution if you plan to use it in
   production.
